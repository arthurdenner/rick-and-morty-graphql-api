# The Rick and Morty GraphQL API

This is a GraphQL wrapper over the [Rick and Morty API](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api) ([Documentation](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation)), which is based on the television show [Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty). Using it, you will access to data about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes.

**To get started, you can jump right to [GraphiQL](https://rickandmortyapi-gql.now.sh/) to see the docs and write some queries.**

This wrapper exposes _almost_ the same data as the REST API, including the `info` property on the response for various characters, episodes or locations.
